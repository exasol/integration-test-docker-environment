# 5.0.0 - 2025-12-05
This release adds support for docker-db version 2025.1.8.

Exasol removed older Docker images from Docker Hub.

The ones still available are:

- 2025.1.8
- 8.29.13
- 7.1.30

Therefore, we removed old configurations from the ITDE and marked this release as a major release, since it is a kind of breaking change.
